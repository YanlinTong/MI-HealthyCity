# MI Healthy City

The **Michigan Healthy City Tool (MI-HealthyCity)** is a interactive data tool created to consolidate data, determine priorities, and identify strategies surrounding health equity and the social determinants of health (SDOH) in Michigan. 

Adapted from global frameworks such as the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART), which has guided urban health planning in over 100 cities worldwide, the MI-HealthyCity Tool provides a localized, data-driven approach to assessing urban health disparities within Michigan communities.

## 🗺️ Level of Analysis

MI-HealthyCity includes data at the **census-tract level** for the **24 largest cities in Michigan** (population ≥ 60,000 according to the 2020 Census).  
This level of granularity enables detailed neighborhood-level assessments, helping to uncover disparities that may not appear in city- or county-level statistics.

## 👥 Demographics and Indicators

Demographic characteristics such as **age**, **gender**, and **race/ethnicity** were incorporated to better understand census-tract composition and its relationship to health outcomes.  
A total of **43 indicators** were identified and categorized into **six domains**, capturing health outcomes, health behaviors, and social determinants of health.  
The data were compiled from **10+ nationwide databases**, including ACS 5-Year Estimates, CDC PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, HUD Picture of Subsidized Households, ICPSR National Neighborhood Data Archive, etc.
